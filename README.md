# Javascript-code-quiz
Learning Javascript can be fun, and challenging.  So I made a fun little quiz with a few questions in it all pertaining to general Javascript knowledge.

## Features of the quiz

```
- an active timer that runs down during the test
- each missed question takes away 10 seconds from the timer
- stored high scores displayed on a seperate page
- button to clear local storage and remove high scores

```
